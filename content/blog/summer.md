# Summer time

It is finally starting to warm up in Utah which is great. With June approaching, my wife and I will be getting our first puppy which is exciting!

Puppy aside, I am now exploring a new programming language, Clojure, which has been interesting. I do not have a strong love of the JVM (my experience with Sprint Boot has been scarring at times); however, Clojure does seem very interesting. After watching [this youtube overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPNkH-7PRTk), I am at least committed to now learn the syntax.

As it stands, I am now following along with [Brave Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com/) to learn more. Time will tell on how that goes!
