Hi! My name is Kevin Laborda. I am a 35 years old full-stack developer currented based in Salt Lake City, UT. I enjoy working with a variety of technologies including the following:

- React
- Node.js
- Python
- Docker
- k8s
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL

My hope for this space is to track and collect my thoughts on various projects/issues that I encounter.
